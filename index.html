                <h3>Indigenous Land and Water Acknowledgment</h3>
                Water management and governance in California is a system rooted in the displacement of Indigenous people. This system has been shaped by historical legacies of institutional and environmental racism that lead to disproportionate access to safe, clean, and affordable drinking water. 
                <br>
                <br>The Luskin Center for Innovation at UCLA acknowledges our presence on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Gabrielino/Tongva peoples.
                <br>
                <br>We recognize that there is no justice without the return of sacred land and water to native peoples. We also acknowledge the critical role water protectors and Indigenous organizers  have in shaping the future of water in California. We invite you to connect with those groups directly to learn more about Indigenous environmental justice work. 
                <br>
                <br>Our hope is that this tool is useful for all communities to better understand and navigate their local water systems and water system governance in order to advocate for just and equitable access to clean and affordable drinking water.
                <br>
                <br>This map is a continuous work in progress. We welcome your feedback on how it can best serve your community and how we can work together to increase accessibility to water data.
